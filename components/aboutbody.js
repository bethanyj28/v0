      <p>
        I have been building backend systems powering web experience since 2018.
        I started my career at Red Ventures, where I worked on applications that
        provided support to teams across the company. These projects included a
        chat application that smartly routed users to live agents, a
        monetization system for tracking leads on education sites, and a content
        tagging system to facilitate relating and categorizing content across
        multiple brands.

        After four years at Red Ventures, I decided to take the next step in my
        career and joined GitHub at the beginning of 2022. I currently work in
        the Actions space and focus on the backend systems that power Actions
        outputs such as logs and artifacts.

        I am passionate about making coding as accessible as possible. I see
        this both in my work at GitHub and my commitment to mentoring. I focus
        on mentoring students who are just getting started in the industry to
        pass on necessary technical skills and give them the confidence to
        believe they do deserve to be here.
