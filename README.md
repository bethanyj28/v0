# My personal site ðŸŽ‰

## Tech stack

### React vs. Vue
I knew I wanted to use React. I feel like Vue would resonate better with me, but I've found more times in my career that React was more important to know than Vue. I also acknowledge there are more options than React and Vue, but those were the two that would further my professional growth.

### Next.js vs. Gatsby vs. `create-react-app`
This was a tougher decision. While I could've just used plain React, I thought it would make the site more extensibile and easy to develop in if I used a framework to assist with the generation and compilation of the site. After a lot of failed attempts using Gatsby and `create-react-app`, I ended up taking a Next.js tutorial and really loving it. While SSR might be overkill for a personal site, I felt the dynamic pages of Next.js would allow me to easily add a blog when I choose to go after that.

### Styled-Components vs. Chakra vs. Tailwind
I know these aren't very equatable, but it was essentially my journey to choosing a CSS framework. At first, I loved Styled-Components because it was still _like_ writing CSS but less clunky. However, I came to terms with the fact that I am not a CSS master and need help. I then pivoted to Chakra since the UI on my team was built using that. It was pretty nice and I admit I didn't give it much of a chance. I ended up watching a Tailwind tutorial on YouTube and seeing how easy and flexible it was, I was convinced.
